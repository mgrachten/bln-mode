;; Navigating the cursor across long lines of text by keyboard in Emacs can be
;; cumbersome, since commands like `forward-char', `backward-char',
;; `forward-word', and `backward-word' move sequentially, and potentially
;; require a lot of repeated executions to arrive at the desired position.  This
;; package provides the binary line navigation minor-mode (`bln-mode'), to
;; address this issue.  It defines the commands `bln-forward-half' and
;; `bln-backward-half', which allow for navigating from any position in a line to
;; any other position in that line by recursive binary subdivision.

;; For instance, if the cursor is at position K, invoking `bln-backward-half' will
;; move the cursor to position K/2. Successively invoking `bln-forward-half'
;; (without moving the cursor in between invocations) will move the cursor to
;; K/2 + K/4, whereas a second invocation of `bln-backward-half' would move the
;; cursor to K/2 - K/4.

;; Below is an illustration of how you can use binary line navigation to reach
;; character `e' at column 10 from character `b' at column 34 in four steps:
;;
;;                   ________________|     `bln-backward-half'
;;          ________|                      `bln-backward-half'
;;         |___                            `bln-forward-half'
;;            _|                           `bln-backward-half'
;; ..........e.......................b.....
;;
;; This approach requires at most log(N) invocations to move from any position
;; to any other position in a line of N characters.  Note that when you move in
;; the wrong direction---by mistakenly invoking `bln-backward-half' instead of
;; `bln-forward-half' or vice versa---you can interrupt the current binary
;; navigation sequence by moving the cursor away from its current position (for
;; example, by `forward-char'). You can then start the binary navigation again
;; from that cursor position.

;; By default the commands `bln-backward-half' and `bln-forward-half' are bound to M-[
;; and M-], respectively.  Depending on your keyboard layout, these keys may not
;; be very convenient.  For more convenient binary line navigation, you could
;; bind to more convenient keys, like M-j and M-k (at the expense of losing the
;; default bindings for `indent-new-comment-line', and `kill-sentence',
;; respectively):

;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-j") 'bln-backward-half)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "M-k") 'bln-forward-half)

  "Toggle binary line navigation mode.

Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode. A
positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
argument disables it. From Lisp, argument omitted or nil enables
the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.

Navigating the cursor across long lines of text by keyboard in
Emacs can be cumbersome, since commands like `forward-char',
`backward-char', `forward-word', and `backward-word' move the
cursor linearly, and potentially require a lot of repeated
executions to arrive at the desired position. `bln-mode'
addresses this issue. It defines the commands `bln-forward-half' and
`bln-backward-half' that allow for navigating from any position in a
line to any other position in that line by recursive binary
subdivision.

For instance, if the cursor is at position K, invoking
`bln-backward-half' will move the cursor to position
K/2. Successively invoking `bln-forward-half' will move the cursor to
K/2 + K/4, whereas a second invocation of `bln-backward-half' would
move the cursor to K/2 - K/4.

Below is an illustration of how you can use binary line navigation
to reach character `e' at column 10 from character `b' at column
34 in four steps:

                  ________________|     `bln-backward-half'
         ________|                      `bln-backward-half'
        |___                            `bln-forward-half'
           _|                           `bln-backward-half'
..........e.......................b.....

This approach requires at most log(N) invocations to move from
any position to any other position in a line of N
characters. Note that when you move in the wrong direction---by
mistakenly invoking `bln-backward-half' instead of `bln-forward-half' or
vice versa---you can interrupt the current binary navigation
sequence by moving the cursor away from its current position (for
example, by `forward-char'). You can then start the binary
navigation again from that cursor position.
